# dotfiles
My dotfiles for macOS and Linux.

## What's inside?
- Sublime Text 3 configs (including Package Control)
- Global `npm` modules and `brew` packages (including Casks)
- My .gitconfig
- ZSH prompt
- macOS tweaks
- Apps and fonts for macOS
- My `zsh` configuration (including [Blox](https://github.com/yardnsm/blox-zsh-theme) theme)
- My `tmux` configuration
- My AppleScripts (automagically compiling them)

## What's going to be here?
- (more advanced) Update script
- Magics ðŸŽ©âœ¨

## Installation
```bash
# give permissions
chmod +x ./install.sh

# I recommend to run under sudo permissions
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Update script
Currently only updates `zsh` and `tmux` configurations. If you are using macOS it will also run macOS tweaks and recompile AppleScripts.
